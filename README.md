# aws_lightsail_wordpress_installer
AWS LightSail Wordpress installer.  

The goal is to do the heavy lifting to be able to install with either a single command, or with an init script in LightSail. 


Development work will be done in a side branch, and this will be based on the AWS Linux Image in LightSail.

More documentation will be added as this expands, and it should be simple.
